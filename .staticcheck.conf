# Staticcheck configuration for arena-cache
# We temporarily disable a handful of style checks that are noisy for the
# evolving codebase. They can be re‑enabled incrementally as documentation and
# usage stabilise.

checks = [
  "all",
  "-ST1000", # package comment missing (will add later)
  "-ST1020", # comment form enforcement
  "-U1000",  # unused (false‑positives across generics / build tags)
  "-SA1019", # deprecation (rand.Seed in benchmarks only)
  "-SA4006", # assigned but not used (loader.go shadow false positive)
]

# Honour goexperiment.arenas build tag
